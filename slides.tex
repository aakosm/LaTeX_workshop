\section{Introduction}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Overview}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item What is (La)Tex and why use it?
		\item Goal of the workshop
		\item Very short first steps to get set up
		\item Using citation manager and LaTeX together
		\item CEU LaTeX template
		\item some other things that might be useful
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What is LaTeX?}
	TeX is a typesetting system. LaTeX is a set of macros that allows you to deal with text only and leave the formatting headache behind. \pause
	\bigskip

	\textbf{Goal of the workshop:} \pause
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item to give enough intro that you can start writing your papers in LaTeX
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Why use LaTeX?}
	Pros:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Output looks professional \pause
		\item Platform independent and reproducible output \pause
		\item Document formatting is not an issue \pause
		\item Writing and text dominates the workflow \pause
	\end{itemize}
	\medskip

	Cons:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Steep learning curve \pause
		\item Initially you get work done slower \pause
		\item Can be hard to step out of the WYSIWYG comfort zone \pause
		\item Formatting tables is truly painful
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Of course there's research on this}
	"We show that LaTeX users were \textbf{slower} than Word users, \textbf{wrote less} text in the same amount of time, and produced more typesetting, orthographical, grammatical, and formatting errors.
	\medskip 
	
	On most measures, \textbf{expert LaTeX users performed even worse than novice Word users}. LaTeX users, however, more often report \textbf{enjoying} using their respective software."

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Bottomline}
LaTeX won't make you more productive or your paper any better. Absolutely no one will be impressed by your text editor or language of choice. Writing in LaTeX is purely a personal, subjective choice.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Survival essentials}
Absolutely essential survival tricks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ALWAYS have at least two (2) backups of your work (one physical copy, one cloud backup). This is the bare minimum. Best is to have a (1) dedicated backup SSD and (2) your work computer HDD/SSD from which the (3) cloud syncs. (You can use whatever service you wish, like Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, but use one!) \pause
    \item ALWAYS use a bibliography manager! At this point there are no excuses not to use one of these: Zotero, Mandaley, Endnote. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Getting started}
What you need installed on Windows:
\begin{itemize}
\item MiKTeX  (\url{https://miktex.org/about})
\item Tex Live (\url{https://tug.org/texlive/})
\end{itemize}

On Mac OS X:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Mac TeX (\url{http://tug.org/mactex})
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
Online option: \url{https://www.overleaf.com} account where you can do all of this online like a google doc.

I would recommend Overleaf for starters because it makes things easier.
\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Getting started}
Actual writing is done in a text editor of your choice. Dedicated TeX editors are (non exhaustive list):

\begin{itemize}
		\item TeXmaker
		\item TeXstudio
		\item TeXworks
\end{itemize}

Or use a general purpose text editor with a LaTeX add-on:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Visual Studio Code
	\item Sublime Text
	\item Atom
	\item emacs
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{itemize}
\item CEU dissertation template: \url{http://www.personal.ceu.hu/tex/thesis/}
\item \url{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/} - tutorial everything that you'll need (most likely)
\item Google (seriously) and \url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/}

\begin{frame}[t]\frametitle{Adding references with natbib}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Have \textbf{usepackage[round]{natbib}} in your preambulum.
        \item You can choose the type of citation you prefer in the [param] space
        \item you add the bibliography to your document with a bibliography\{your\_bibfile\}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}[t]\frametitle{How it looks like with Zotero}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Right click on your collection folder on the left panel
	\item 'Export collection'
	\item Format as BibTeX
	\item Save it into the same folder as your main .tex 
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}[t]\frametitle{How to cite with natbib}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item You can put the source in parenthesis like (Einstein 1999) with citep\{bib\_key\}
		\item Just the date, like: Einstein (1999) with citet\{bib\_key\}
	\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{setting up your dissertation in LaTeX}
\begin{itemize}
\item A main .tex file that contains the link to the chapters, preambulum, title page, acknowledgement, etc.
\item Each chapter is a separate .tex file
\item The .bib file with your references
\item Whatever figures and tables you want to include
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
Some of the advice is outdated in the CEU template if you use Overleaf or TeXstudio or other contemporary editor:
e.g.: don't worry about the order to run pdflatex and bibtex to get your final document, the software does it for you.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The workflow with the CEU template} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Have all your packages and extra formatting options in the preambulum in your main .tex \pause
	\item Decide on the citation package you want to use (I recommend either 'natbib' or 'biblatex') \pause
	\item Use your citation manager of choice (Zotero, Endnote, Mandaley, etc.) to collect your references and then export it to your .bib file \pause
	\item Finish your dissertation and graduate
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Using LaTeX for CVs, or presentations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item You can find plenty of great LaTeX CV templates on Overleaf which you can modify after.
    \item The "beamer" class creates the presentation format (such as this one)
    \item If you want to draw great looking flowcharts or other graphics, you can use the \texttt{tikz} package
    \item 	All of the previous disclaimer applies to these as well: only do it if you enjoy it, or absolutely must.
\end{itemize}
